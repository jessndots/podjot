UglifyJS 3
==========

UglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor and beautifier toolkit.

#### Note:
- **`uglify-js@3` has a simplified [API](#api-reference) and [CLI](#command-line-usage) that is not backwards compatible with [`uglify-js@2`](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/tree/v2.x)**.
- **Documentation for UglifyJS `2.x` releases can be found [here](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/tree/v2.x)**.
- `uglify-js` only supports JavaScript (ECMAScript 5).
- To minify ECMAScript 2015 or above, transpile using tools like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

Install
-------

First make sure you have installed the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
(You may need to restart your computer after this step).

From NPM for use as a command line app:

    npm install uglify-js -g

From NPM for programmatic use:

    npm install uglify-js

# Command line usage

    uglifyjs [input files] [options]

UglifyJS can take multiple input files.  It's recommended that you pass the
input files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files
in sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the
same global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some
variable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.

If no input file is specified, UglifyJS will read from STDIN.

If you wish to pass your options before the input files, separate the two with
a double dash to prevent input files being used as option arguments:

    uglifyjs --compress --mangle -- input.js

                                                modules and Userscripts that may
                                                be anonymous function wrapped (IIFE)
                                                by the .user.js engine `caller`.
                                `expression`  Parse a single expression, rather than
                                              a program (for parsing JSON).
                                `spidermonkey`  Assume input files are SpiderMonkey
                                                AST format (as JSON).
    -c, --compress [options]    Enable compressor/specify compressor options:
                                `pure_funcs`  List of functions that can be safely
                                              removed when their return values are
                                              not used.
    -m, --mangle [options]      Mangle names/specify mangler options:

    --mangle-props [options]    Mangle properties/specify mangler options:
                                `builtins`  Mangle property names that overlaps
                                            with standard JavaScript globals.
                                `debug`  Add debug prefix and suffix.
                                `domprops`  Mangle property names that overlaps

                                `regex`  Only mangle matched property names.
                                `reserved`  List of names that should not be mangled.
    -b, --beautify [options]    Beautify output/specify output options:
                                `beautify`  Enabled with `--beautify` by default.
                                `preamble`  Preamble to prepend to the output. You
                                            can use this to insert a comment, for
                                            example for licensing information.
                                            This will not be parsed, but the source
                                            map will adjust for its presence.
                                `quote_style`  Quote style:
                                               0 - auto
                                               1 - single
                                               2 - double
                                               3 - original
                                `wrap_iife`  Wrap IIFEs in parenthesis. Note: you may
                                             want to disable `negate_iife` under
                                             compressor options.
    -o, --output <file>         Output file path (default STDOUT). Specify `ast` or
                                `spidermonkey` to write UglifyJS or SpiderMonkey AST
                                as JSON to STDOUT respectively.
    --comments [filter]         Preserve copyright comments in the output. By
                                default this works like Google Closure, keeping
                                JSDoc-style comments that contain "@license" or
                                "@preserve". You can optionally pass one of the
                                following arguments to this flag:
                                - "all" to keep all comments
                                - a valid JS RegExp like `/foo/` or `/^!/` to
                                keep only matching comments.
                                Note that currently not *all* comments can be
                                kept when compression is on, because of dead
                                code removal or cascading statements into
                                sequences.
    --config-file <file>        Read `minify()` options from JSON file.
    -d, --define <expr>[=value] Global definitions.
    -e, --enclose [arg[:value]] Embed everything in a big function, with configurable
                                argument(s) & value(s).
    --ie8                       Support non-standard Internet Explorer 8.
                                Equivalent to setting `ie8: true` in `minify()`
                                for `compress`, `mangle` and `output` options.
                                By default UglifyJS will not try to be IE-proof.
    --keep-fnames               Do not mangle/drop function names.  Useful for
                                code relying on Function.prototype.name.
    --name-cache <file>         File to hold mangled name mappings.
    --self                      Build UglifyJS as a library (implies --wrap UglifyJS)
    --source-map [options]      Enable source map/specify source map options:
                                `base`  Path to compute relative paths from input files.
                                `content`  Input source map, useful if you're compressing
                                           JS that was generated from some other original
                                           code. Specify "inline" if the source map is
                                           included within the sources.
                                `filename`  Filename and/or location of the output source
                                            (sets `file` attribute in source map).
                                `includeSources`  Pass this flag if you want to include
                                                  the content of source files in the
                                                  source map as sourcesContent property.
                                `root`  Path to the original source to be included in
                                        the source map.
                                `url`  If specified, path to the source map to append in
                                       `//# sourceMappingURL`.
    --timings                   Display operations run time on STDERR.
    --toplevel                  Compress and/or mangle variables in top level scope.
    --verbose                   Print diagnostic messages.
    --warn                      Print warning messages.
    --wrap <name>               Embed everything in a big function, making the
                                “exports” and “global” variables available. You
                                need to pass an argument to this option to
                                specify the name that your module will take
                                when included in, say, a browser.
```

Specify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output
goes to STDOUT.

## CLI source map options

UglifyJS can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for
debugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass
`--source-map --output output.js` (source map will be written out to
`output.js.map`).

Additional options:

- `--source-map "filename='<NAME>'"` to specify the name of the source map. The value of
  `filename` is only used to set `file` attribute (see [the spec][sm-spec])
  in source map file.

- `--source-map "root='<URL>'"` to pass the URL where the original files can be found.

- `--source-map "url='<URL>'"` to specify the URL where the source map can be found.
  Otherwise UglifyJS assumes HTTP `X-SourceMap` is being used and will omit the
  `//# sourceMappingURL=` directive.

For example:

    uglifyjs js/file1.js js/file2.js \
             -o foo.min.js -c -m \
             --source-map "root='http://foo.com/src',url='foo.min.js.map'"

The above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the
output in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source
mapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and
`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`
as the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and
`js/file2.js`).

### Composed source map

When you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as
CoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd
like to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an
option to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from
CoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →
compressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original
location.

To use this feature pass `--source-map "content='/path/to/input/source.map'"`
or `--source-map "content=inline"` if the source map is included inline with
the sources.

## CLI compress options

You need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally
you can pass a comma-separated list of [compress options](#compress-options).

Options are in the form `foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies
a boolean option that you want to set `true`; it's effectively a
shortcut for `foo=true`).

Example:

    uglifyjs file.js -c toplevel,sequences=false

## CLI mangle options

To enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  The following
(comma-separated) options are supported:

- `toplevel` (default `false`) -- mangle names declared in the top level scope.

- `eval` (default `false`) -- mangle names visible in scopes where `eval` or `with` are used.

When mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being
mangled, you can declare those names with `--mangle reserved` — pass a
comma-separated list of names.  For example:

    uglifyjs ... -m reserved=['$','require','exports']

to prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.
