    * Removed the need for del
    
    Removed the need for del as newer versions have broken backwards
    compatibility. del mainly uses rimraf for deleting folders
    and files, replaceing it with rimraf only is a minimal change.
    
    * Disable glob on rimraf calls
    
    * Added glob disable to wrong call
    
    * Wrapped rimraf to simplify solution

- **Bug Fixes**
  - Do not crash if cache file is invalid JSON. ([#13](https://github.com/royriojas/flat-cache/issues/13)) - [87beaa6]( https://github.com/royriojas/flat-cache/commit/87beaa6 ), [Roy Riojas](https://github.com/Roy Riojas), 19/12/2016 18:03:35

    Fixes <a target="_blank" class="info-link" href="https://github.com/royriojas/flat-cache/issues/12"><span>#12</span></a>
    
    Not sure under which situations a cache file might exist that does
    not contain a valid JSON structure, but just in case to cover
    the possibility of this happening a try catch block has been added
    
    If the cache is somehow not valid the cache will be discarded an a
    a new cache will be stored instead
